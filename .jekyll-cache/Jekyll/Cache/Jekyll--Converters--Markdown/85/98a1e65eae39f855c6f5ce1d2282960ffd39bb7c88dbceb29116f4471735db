<h2 id="release-highlights">Release Highlights</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Anomaly Detection supports a <a href="https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/anomaly-detection/tree/master/cli">command line interface</a> that allows users to create, start, stop and delete detectors, and work with multiple clusters using named profiles.</li>
  <li>Anomaly Detection supports three different types of <a href="https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/anomaly-detection-kibana-plugin/pull/272">sample detectors and corresponding indices</a> that allow users to detect sample anomalies using logs related to HTTP response codes, eCommerce orders, and CPU and memory of a host.</li>
  <li>The Alerting feature now supports <a href="https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/alerting/pull/244">email destinations</a> to send notifications without using a web hook.</li>
  <li>K-NN supports <a href="https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/k-NN#warmup-api">warmup API</a> that allows users to explicitly load indices‚Äô graphs used for approximate k-NN search into memory before performing their search workload. With this API, users no longer need to run random queries to prevent initial latency penalties for loading graphs into the cache.</li>
  <li>The updated Kibana plugin for Security streamlines security workflows, improves usability and adds audit and compliance logging configuration.</li>
</ul>
