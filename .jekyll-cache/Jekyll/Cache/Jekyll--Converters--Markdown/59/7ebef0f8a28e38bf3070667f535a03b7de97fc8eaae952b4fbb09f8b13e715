<p>Personally, Iâ€™ve always wanted to contribute to an open-source project, but never found a way to incorporate it with my day-to-day work. Occasionally, Iâ€™d muster up the courage to clone a project I liked, seeking a good entry point to add some new feature or handle some issue. I thought that all I needed was to make a small contribution and everything else would just flow into place.</p>
