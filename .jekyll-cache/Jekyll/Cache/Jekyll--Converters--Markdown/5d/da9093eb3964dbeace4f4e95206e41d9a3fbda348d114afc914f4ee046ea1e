I"[<p>If you want to add something to OpenSearch that is not in the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/opensearch-project/projects/1">public roadmap</a>, thatâ€™s a perfect opportunity to contribute! There are a couple of things you can do.</p>

<p>You can create a <a href="https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/blob/main/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/FEATURE_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md">feature request</a> in the relevant GitHub repo for the feature and socialize the request. People are always looking for in-demand features to build. A maintainer or someone else in the community may pick this feature up and work on it. As progress is made the maintainers of the repo will help get the feature onto the roadmap.</p>

<p>Another option is to build the feature yourself. To do this create a proposal as a GitHub issue in the relevant repo and use the <a href="https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/blob/main/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md">proposal template</a> (thanks <a href="https://github.com/jkowall">jkowall</a> for contributing the template!). Offer your commitment to build it. The maintainers of the repo will work with you to figure out how best to proceed. That could be further discussion, design docs, or just starting to write the code. As the feature is developed, the maintainers of the repo will also work with you to incorporate it into the roadmap.</p>
