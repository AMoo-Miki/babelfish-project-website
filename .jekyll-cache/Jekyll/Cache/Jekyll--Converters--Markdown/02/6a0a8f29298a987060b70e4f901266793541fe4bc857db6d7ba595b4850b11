I"±<p>We plan to publish a series of blogs discussing the science and math behind Random Cut Forests (RCF). In this first post we begin with a brief overview of Random Forests as a class of Machine Learning model. Next, we introduce RCFs and highlight their relevance to streaming data. Finally, we close with a look to the future, giving ideas for how RCFs support an Online Learning approach to a variety of statistical problems.</p>
