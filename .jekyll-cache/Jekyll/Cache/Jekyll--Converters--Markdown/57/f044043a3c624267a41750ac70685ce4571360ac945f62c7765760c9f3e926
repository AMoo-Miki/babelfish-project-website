I"Û<p>Today, we released Anomaly Detection (preview) on Open Distro for Elasticsearch. We are excited to continue our work on anomaly detection as a part of Open Distro for Elasticsearch in the coming months, and invite developers in the larger search community to join in and co-develop some parts. The feature includes a nice mix of machine learning algorithms, statistics methods, systems work, visualization and UI, and enterprise primitives (for working on anomalies).</p>
