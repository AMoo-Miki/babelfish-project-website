<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>

<h3 id="index-management">Index Management</h3>

<p>The Index management plugin in Open Distro for Elasticsearch provides an automated system for recurring index state management tasks, eliminating the need rely on external systems to execute them periodically. The Kibana plugin for index management provides users an administrative panel to monitor the indices and apply policies at different stages in its lifecycle based on user defined criteria like index age, size, or number of documents. Index state management lets users define unlimited custom policies to be applied to index patterns, and move indices from one state to another. Within each state users can define a list of actions to perform and the criteria to transition to a new state.</p>

<h3 id="open-distro-for-elasticsearch-deployment-for-kubernetes">Open Distro for Elasticsearch Deployment for Kubernetes</h3>

<p>With the new Helm chart for Open Distro for Elasticsearch, users can scale out Elasticsearch deployments in Kubernetes and Amazon EKS. This Helm chart supports installation and update of Elasticsearch and Kibana. The Helm chart enables users to set up master, client and data nodes. It also provides options for security settings like TLS, custom certificates, RBAC, multi-tenancy for the cluster.</p>

<h3 id="cloud-formation-templates">Cloud formation templates</h3>

<p>Users can now create a full Open Distro for Elasticsearch cluster, including secure networking provided through VPC, configurable data notes, master nodes and a client node. The client node provides Kibana access with a public IP address. <Add link="" to="" these="" templates=""></Add></p>

<h2 id="packages-and-features-under-development">Packages and features under development</h2>

<p>We‚Äôre also excited to announce an alpha version of a Windows installer and new plugins in development. We invite you to join in to submit issues and PRs on features, bugs, and tests you need or build.</p>

<h3 id="open-distro-for-elasticsearch-deployment-on-windows">Open Distro for Elasticsearch deployment on Windows</h3>

<p>With Windows exe supporting version 1.3.0, users can now easily install Elasticsearch and Kibana on Windows and run it as a service. This service has been tested on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019.</p>

<h3 id="anomaly-detection">Anomaly Detection</h3>

<p>Machine learning based anomaly detection has been released as an alpha plugin and is under active development. The anomaly detection feature can handle large volumes of high dimensional data and detect outliers in real-time. The anomaly detection feature depends on the underlying <a href="https://github.com/aws/random-cut-forest-by-aws">Random Cut Forest</a> (RCF) library, a proven algorithm for streaming use cases. RCF is also now open source  and provides better visibility into the anomaly detection decision framework.</p>

<h3 id="performance-analyzer-root-cause-analysis-rca-framework">Performance Analyzer Root Cause Analysis (RCA) framework</h3>

<p>The Performance Analyzer RCA is a framework that builds on the Performance Analyzer engine to support Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of performance and reliability problems in Elasticsearch clusters. This framework executes real time root cause analyses using Performance Analyzer metrics. You can now weigh in your feedback on the <a href="https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/performance-analyzer/blob/master/rca/rfc-rca.pdf">design proposal</a> released recently.</p>
