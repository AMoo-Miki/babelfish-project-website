I"Ì<p>Today is a really good day for the OpenSearch project. Since its start, the goal has been to quickly produce a version of OpenSearch thatâ€™s ready to use in production environments. After a ton of work by the OpenSearch community, weâ€™re thrilled to announce the first general availability (GA) release of OpenSearch 1.0. Everyone in this highly-engaged and diverse community should be proud of the accomplishment in reaching this milestone together.</p>
