<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>

<h3 id="k-nn-plugin">k-NN plugin</h3>

<p>Our new k-NN search plugin enables high scale, low latency nearest neighbor search on billions of documents across thousands of dimensions with the same ease as running any regular Elasticsearch query. Built using the <a href="https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib">Non-Metric Space Library</a> (NMSLIB), this plugin can power use cases such as product recommendations, fraud detection, and image, video, and related document search. We have extended the Apache Lucene codec to introduce a new file format to store vector data. k-NN Search uses the standard Elasticsearch mapping and query syntax ‚Äîto designate a field as a k-NN vector you can simply map it to the new k-NN field type provided by the k-NN plugin. k-NN functionality integrates seamlessly with other Elasticsearch features. This provides users  the flexibility to use Elasticsearch‚Äôs extensive search features such as
aggregations and filtering with k-NN to further improve the search results. Learn more at <a href="https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/k-NN">k-NN</a></p>

<h2 id="packages-and-features-under-development">Packages and features under development</h2>

<h3 id="anomaly-detection">Anomaly Detection</h3>

<p>Machine learning based anomaly detection has been released as an alpha plugin and is under active development. The anomaly detection feature can handle large volumes of high dimensional data and detect outliers in real-time. The anomaly detection feature depends on the underlying <a href="https://github.com/aws/random-cut-forest-by-aws">Random Cut Forest</a> (RCF) library, a proven algorithm for streaming use cases. RCF is also now open source  and provides better visibility into the anomaly detection decision framework.</p>

<h3 id="performance-analyzer-root-cause-analysis-rca-framework">Performance Analyzer Root Cause Analysis (RCA) framework</h3>

<p>The Performance Analyzer RCA is a framework that builds on the Performance Analyzer engine to support Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of performance and reliability problems in Elasticsearch clusters. This framework executes real time root cause analyses using Performance Analyzer metrics. You can now weigh in your feedback on the <a href="https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/performance-analyzer/blob/master/rca/rfc-rca.pdf">design proposal</a> released recently.</p>
