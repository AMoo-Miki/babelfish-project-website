I"<p>OpenSearch supports rolling upgrades in the same way as Elasticsearch OSS. You can deploy OpenSearch into a mixed cluster with Elasticsearch OSS or Open Distro for Elasticsearch nodes. One by one you can replace the legacy nodes with little to no additional manual work.</p>

<p>In the same way as Kibana OSS, OpenSearch Dashboards does not support rolling upgrades, but it supports restart upgrades. You are able to stop all Kibana OSS instances, deploy a new OpenSearch Dashboards instance and direct traffic to it.</p>
