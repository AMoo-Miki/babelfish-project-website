## Installing from Docker

One way to get Babelfish installed is by running it as a docker container. 

Running the following command will result in a Babelfish instance running as a docker container:

``` sh
docker run --name babelfish  \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secretbabelfishpassword \
  -d {{site.data.images[0].image}} \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -p 1433:1433
```

After the above command completes Babelfish should be up and running. The port `5432` would listen for 
  FE/BE connections (PostgreSQL protocol) while `1433` would listen for TDS connections (MS-SQL Server protocol).

## Installing from source code

### Getting the source code
Babelfish is separated in two repos, the first of them contains the PostgreSQL database engine, with some changes 
 that enables the protocol hooks. The second one contains extensions to support the T-SQL protocol, T-SQL Database, etc..

The Babelfish PostgreSQL engine source code can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/postgresql_modified_for_babelfish). 

The Babelfish extensions source code can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish_extensions).

If you have git installed, you can clone the repos with the following command: 

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/postgresql_modified_for_babelfish.git
git clone https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish_extensions.git
```

#### Requirements
To be able to build Babelfish, you need to install the following tools:

- [Flex 2.6.4](https://github.com/westes/flex)
- [Libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org/) development libraries
- [Libxstl](http://www.xmlsoft.org/libxslt/) development libraries
- [xsltproc](http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html)
- [Open SSL](https://www.openssl.org/) development libraries
- [Readline](https://tiswww.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) development libraries
- [Zlib](https://zlib.net/)
- [OpenLDAP](https://www.openldap.org/) development libraries
- [Linux-PAM](http://www.linux-pam.org/) development libraries
- [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/)
- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2714/)
- [OSSP uuid](http://www.ossp.org/pkg/lib/uuid/) development libraries
- [LLVM-based linker](https://lld.llvm.org/)
- [pkg-config](https://linux.die.net/man/1/pkg-config)
- [Gnulib](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/)
- [ICU](https://icu.unicode.org/) development libraries
- [Gawk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/) 
- [Bison 3.0.5](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)

#### Installing the requirements

You can install most the requirements with the following command, depending of your system configuration 
 you might need to run these commands with sudo:

``` sh
apt install -y build-essential flex libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libssl-dev
apt install -y libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev libldap2-dev libpam0g-dev gettext python2.7 python2.7-dev
apt install -y uuid uuid-dev lld pkg-config libossp-uuid-dev gnulib
apt install -y libxml2-utils xsltproc icu-devtools libicu66 libicu-dev gawk
```

Nonetheless, for bison it is better to install it from its source code. 
##### Installing bison
We can download the bison source code with the following command:

``` sh
curl http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bison/bison-3.0.5.tar.gz --output /tmp/bison-3.0.5.tar.gz
```

Once downloaded, we can uncompress source code:
``` sh
tar xzf /tmp/bison-3.0.5.tar.gz  -C /opt/
```

Now we can compile and install bison:
``` sh
cd /opt/bison-3.0.5
./configure 
make 
make install 
```


#### Configuring the Babelfish PosgresSQL source tree

Before compiling the Babelfish PostgreSQL source code we need to configure the build. To do that we 
 need to run `configure` script, in the directory where you have downloaded the Babelfish PostgreSQL Engine sources:

``` sh
./configure CFLAGS="${CFLAGS:--Wall -Wmissing-prototypes -Wpointer-arith -Wdeclaration-after-statement -Wendif-labels -Wmissing-format-attribute -Wformat-security -fno-strict-aliasing -fwrapv -fexcess-precision=standard -O2 -g -pipe -Wall -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fexceptions -fstack-protector-strong --param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -grecord-gcc-switches -m64 -mtune=generic}" \
  --enable-thread-safety \
  --enable-cassert \
  --enable-debug \
  --with-ldap \
  --with-python \
  --with-libxml \
  --with-pam \
  --with-uuid=ossp \
  --enable-nls \
  --with-libxslt \
  --with-icu \
  --with-python PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.7 \
  --with-extra-version=" Babelfish for PostgreSQL"
```
The above would configure the installation path under `/usr/local/pgsql`, if you 
 want to change the installation directory you can use the `prefix` flag. Therefore, if you want to change the path to `/usr/local/pgsql-13.4`, you can run the configure script as follows.
 

 ``` sh
 ./configure CFLAGS="${CFLAGS:--Wall -Wmissing-prototypes -Wpointer-arith -Wdeclaration-after-statement -Wendif-labels -Wmissing-format-attribute -Wformat-security -fno-strict-aliasing -fwrapv -fexcess-precision=standard -O2 -g -pipe -Wall -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fexceptions -fstack-protector-strong --param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -grecord-gcc-switches -m64 -mtune=generic}" \
  --prefix=/usr/local/pgsql-13.4 \
  --enable-thread-safety \
  --enable-cassert \
  --enable-debug \
  --with-ldap \
  --with-python \
  --with-libxml \
  --with-pam \
  --with-uuid=ossp \
  --enable-nls \
  --with-libxslt \
  --with-icu \
  --with-python PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.7 \
  --with-extra-version=" Babelfish for PostgreSQL"
 ```

#### Building Babelfish PostgreSQL engine
Now that we have configured the source tree, we can build Babelfish with the 
 following command:

``` sh
INSTALLATION_PATH=<the path you specified as prefix>
mkdir "$INSTALLATION_PATH"
make # Compiles the Babefish PostgreSQL engine
cd contrib 
make # Compiles the PostgreSQL default extensions
cd ..
make install # Installs the Babelfish PostgreSQL engine
cd contrib
make install # Installs the PostgreSQL default extensions
```

#### Building Babelfish Extensions

In order to build the extensions we would need to install some additional tool: 

##### Additional requied tools
- [Antlr 4.9.2 Runtime](https://www.antlr.org/)
- [Open Java 8](https://openjdk.java.net/)
- Unzip
- [libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/libpq.html)
- [pkgconf](http://pkgconf.org/)
- libutfcpp development libraries
- [CMake 3.20.6](https://cmake.org/)

You can install most of this tools by running the command:

``` sh
apt install -y openjdk-8-jre openssl python-dev libpq-dev pkgconf unzip libutfcpp-dev
```

For the CMake and Antlr4 Runtime is better to install it from it source code. 

##### Installing CMake

We can install CMake by running the following script:

``` sh
curl -L https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.20.6/cmake-3.20.6-linux-x86_64.sh --output /opt/cmake-3.20.6-linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x /opt/cmake-3.20.6-linux-x86_64.sh 
/opt/cmake-3.20.6-linux-x86_64.sh --prefix=/usr/local --skip-license
```
##### Installing Antlr4 runtime

To install the Antlr4 runtime, we need to have the Antlr4 .jar. Babelfish extensions source code includes this .jar in 
  the path `/contrib/babelfishpg_tsql/antlr/thirdparty/antlr`.

Having this in mind, we can install Antlr4 runtime by running:
``` sh
# Dowloads the compressed Antlr4 Runtime sources on /opt/antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.9.2-source.zip 
curl https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.9.2-source.zip \
  --output /opt/antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.9.2-source.zip 

# Uncompress the source into /opt/antlr4
unzip -d /opt/antlr4 /opt/antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.9.2-source.zip

mkdir /opt/antlr4/build 
cd /opt/antlr4/build

EXTENSIONS_SOURCE_CODE_PATH="<the patch in which you downloaded the Babelfish extensions source code>"

# Generates the make files for the build
cmake .. -DANTLR_JAR_LOCATION="$EXTENSIONS_SOURCE_CODE_PATH/contrib/babelfishpg_tsql/antlr/thirdparty/antlr/antlr-4.9.2-complete.jar" \
         -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DWITH_DEMO=True
# Compiles and install
make
make install
```

Now that we have the antlr4 runtime installed, we need to copy the `libantlr4-runtime.so.4.9.2` library into the installed Babelfish 
 PostgresSQL Engine libs folder. We can do that by running the following command:

``` sh
cp /usr/local/lib/libantlr4-runtime.so.4.9.2 "$INSTALLATION_PATH/lib"
```
# Build and install the extensions

Now that we have all of the tools installed to build the Babelfish extension, we need to configure some environment variables: 

- `PG_CONFIG`: should point to the location of the pg_config file in the Babelfish PostgreSQL Engine installation, in our case: `$INSTALLATION_PATH/bin/pg_config`.

- `PG_SRC`: should point to the location of the Babelfish PostgreSQL engine source folder.

- `cmake`: should contain the path of the cmake binary

Supposing that you have installed the Babelfish PostgreSQL Engine in `/usr/local/pgsql-13.4/`, you have downloaded the Babelfish PostgreSQL Engine source code in `~/postgresql_modified_for_babelfish`, 
and cmake is installed in `/usr/local/bin/cmake`, the environment variables set up would be like this:

``` sh
export PG_CONFIG=/usr/local/pgsql-13.4/bin/pg_config
export PG_SRC=$HOME/postgresql_modified_for_babelfish
export cmake=/usr/local/bin/cmake
```

Now we have all set to build the extensions. To do so, we need to go to the contrib folder in the Babelfish extension source code, and then build the 
extensions one by one. We do it with the following script:

``` sh
# Install babelfishpg_money extension
cd contrib/babelfishpg_money
make
make install

# Install babelfishpg_common extension
cd ../babelfishpg_common
make 
make install

# Install babelfishpg_tds extension
cd ../babelfishpg_tds
make 
make install

# Installs the babelfishpg_tsql extension
cd ../babelfishpg_tsql
make 
make install
```
