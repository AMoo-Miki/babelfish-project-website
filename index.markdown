meta_description: Babelfish for PostgreSQL is an Apache-2.0 open source project that adds a Microsoft SQL Server-compatible end-point to PostgreSQL to enable your PostgreSQL database to understand the SQL Server wire protocol and commonly used SQL Server commands. With Babelfish, PostgreSQL now understands T-SQL, Microsoft SQL Server's proprietary SQL dialect, and supports the same communications protocol, so your apps that were originally written for SQL Server can now work with PostgreSQL with fewer code changes and without changing database drivers.
