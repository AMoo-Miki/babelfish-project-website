# Compiling from source code

Babelfish can be installed by compiling its source code. 

## Requirements

Regardless of the OS that it's being used, there are three tools that are requiered to compile Babelfish, which are:

- [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
- [Flex](https://github.com/westes/flex)
- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2714/)
- [Libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org/)
- [OSSP uuid](http://www.ossp.org/pkg/lib/uuid/)
- A C compiler

### Recommended tools to install
Depending on which PostgreSQL features are needed to be enabled you would need to 
 install additional tools, but the following are recommended in all cases:

- readline: it's required to compile by default, but you can disable it by using 
 the flag `--without-readline`. Nonetheless, it recommended to install it because 
 it allows [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/app-psql.html) to remember 
 the commands that you type, which it be very useful.
- zlib: it's required to compile by default, you can disable it by using the flag
 `--without-zlib`.  If is disabled, pg_dump and pg_restore will not be available. 

## Getting the source code
Babelfish source code can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfishpg-patch-for-postgresql). If you have git installed, you can clone the repo with the following command: 

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfishpg-patch-for-postgresql.git
```

## Installation from source code
Depending of your environment, the building procedure would be different. 

- [Installation from source code on Linux](linuxbuild)
- [Installation from source code on Windows](windowsbuild)
